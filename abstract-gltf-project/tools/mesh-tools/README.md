# Mesh Tools Documentation

This directory contains tools and utilities for working with mesh generation and manipulation in the context of the abstract GLTF project. The mesh tools are designed to facilitate the creation of abstract models that are visually interesting and suitable for various applications.

## Overview

The mesh tools provide functionalities to:

- Generate abstract mesh structures.
- Apply transformations and modifications to existing meshes.
- Export meshes in the GLTF format for use in other applications.

## Usage

To utilize the mesh tools, you can import the relevant modules in your TypeScript files. Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed and configured in your project.

### Example

```typescript
import { generateAbstractMesh } from './mesh-tools/meshGenerator';

// Generate an abstract mesh
const abstractMesh = generateAbstractMesh(parameters);
```
